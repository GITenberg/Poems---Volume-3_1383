&nbsp;&nbsp; Blows in and out of haven;<br />
The wind that blows is the wind that&rsquo;s best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And croak, my jolly raven!<br />
If here awhile we jigged and laughed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The like we will do yonder;<br />
For he&rsquo;s the man who masters a craft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And light as a lord can wander.<br />

<p class="poetry">You live in rows of snug abodes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With gold, maybe, for counting;<br />
And mine&rsquo;s the beck of the rainy roads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the sun a-mounting.<br />
I take the day as it behaves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor shiver when &rsquo;tis airy;<br />
But comes a breeze, all you are on waves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sick chickens o&rsquo; Mother Carey!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, now for next, cries Roving
Tim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And croak, my
jolly raven!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind according to its whim<br

<p class="poetry">Sweet lass, you screw a lovely leer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make a man consider.<br />
If you were up with the auctioneer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be a handsome bidder.<br />
But wedlock clips the rover&rsquo;s wing;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She tricks him fly to spider;<br />
And when we get to fights in the Ring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s trumps when you play outsider.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, wrench and split, cries Roving
Tim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And croak, my
jolly raven!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind according to its whim<br

<h3>IV</h3>
<p class="poetry">Along my winding way I know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A shady dell that&rsquo;s winking;<br />
The very corner for Self and Co<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To do a world of thinking.<br />
And shall I this? and shall I that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till Nature answers, ne&rsquo;ther!<br />
Strike match and light your pipe in your hat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rejoicing in sound shoe-leather!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So lead along, cries Roving
Tim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And croak, my

&nbsp;&nbsp; With freedom for your capers.<br />
I&rsquo;m not so sure of a cunning head;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It steers to pits or vapours.<br />
But as for Life, we&rsquo;ll bear in sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lesson Nature teaches;<br />
Regard it in a sailoring light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And treat it like thirsty leeches.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, fly your jib, cries Roving
Tim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And top your

You say the shopman piles a heap,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While I perhaps am fasting;<br />
And bless your wits, it haunts him in sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His tin-kettle chance of lasting!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So hail the road, cries Roving
Tim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hail the
rain, old raven!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind according to its whim<br

<h3>VII</h3>
<p class="poetry">He&rsquo;s half a wife, yon pecker bill;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A book and likewise preacher.<br />
With any soul, in a game of skill,<br />

<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The reason

You&rsquo;d wish for them when pitching your tent<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, off we go, cries Roving

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on we go,
old raven!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind according to its whim<br

<h3>VIII</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp; To call it woe is blindness:<br />
It&rsquo;ll here a kick, and it&rsquo;s there a kiss,<br />

He starts a hare and calls her joy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He runs her down to sorrow:<br />
The dogs within him bother the boy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis a new day to-morrow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I at helm, cries Roving
Tim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you at bow,
old raven!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind according to its whim<br

5</span>JUMP-TO-GLORY JANE</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">revelation</span> came on
Jane,<br />
The widow of a labouring swain:<br />
And first her body trembled sharp,<br />
Then all the woman was a harp<br />
With winds along the strings; she heard,<br />
Though there was neither tone nor word.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">For past our hearing was the air,<br />
Beyond our speaking what it bare,<br />
And she within herself had sight<br />
Of heaven at work to cleanse outright,<br />
To make of her a mansion fit<br />
For angel hosts inside to sit.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p class="poetry">They entered, and forthwith entranced,<br />
Her body braced, her members danced;<br />
Surprisingly the woman leapt;<br />
And countenance composed she kept:<br />
As gossip neighbours in the lane<br />
Declared, who saw and pitied Jane.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p class="poetry">These knew she had been reading books,<br />
The which was witnessed by her looks<br />
Of late: she had a mania<br />
For mad folk in America,<br />
And said for sure they led the way,<br />
But meat and beer were meant to stay.</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>V</h3>
<p class="poetry">That she had visited a fair,<br />
Had seen a gauzy lady there,<br />
Alive with tricks on legs alone,<br />
As good as wings, was also known:<br />
And longwhiles in a sullen mood,<br />
Before her jumping, Jane would brood.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p class="poetry">A good knee&rsquo;s height, they say, she
sprang;<br />
Her arms and feet like those who hang:<br />
As if afire the body sped,<br />
And neither pair contributed.<br />
She jumped in silence: she was thought<br />
A corpse to resurrection caught.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p class="poetry">The villagers were mostly dazed;<br />
They jeered, they wondered, and they praised.<br />
&rsquo;Twas guessed by some she was inspired,<br />
And some would have it she had hired<br />
An engine in her petticoats,<br />
To turn their wits and win their votes.</p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">Her first was Winny Earnes, a kind<br />
Of woman not to dance inclined;<br />
But she went up, entirely won,<br />
Ere Jump-to-glory Jane had done;<br />
And once a vixen wild for speech,<br />
She found the better way to preach.</p>
<h3><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>IX</h3>
<p class="poetry">No long time after, Jane was seen<br />
Directing jumps at Daddy Green;<br />
And that old man, to watch her fly,<br />
Had eyebrows made of arches high;<br />
Till homeward he likewise did hop,<br />
Oft calling on himself to stop!</p>
<h3>X</h3>
<p class="poetry">It was a scene when man and maid,<br />
Abandoning all other trade,<br />
And careless of the call to meals,<br />
Went jumping at the woman&rsquo;s heels.<br />
By dozens they were counted soon,<br />
Without a sound to tell their tune.</p>
<h3>XI</h3>
<p class="poetry">Along the roads they came, and crossed<br />
The fields, and o&rsquo;er the hills were lost,<br />
And in the evening reappeared;<br />
Then short like hobbled horses reared,<br />
And down upon the grass they plumped:<br />
Alone their Jane to glory jumped.</p>
<h3>XII</h3>
<p class="poetry">At morn they rose, to see her spring<br />
All going as an engine thing;<br />
And lighter than the gossamer<br />
She led the bobbers following her,<br />
Past old acquaintances, and where<br />
They made the stranger stupid stare.</p>
<h3><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>XIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">When turnips were a filling crop,<br />
In scorn they jumped a butcher&rsquo;s shop:<br />
Or, spite of threats to flog and souse,<br />
They jumped for shame a public-house:<br />
And much their legs were seized with rage<br />
If passing by the vicarage.</p>
<h3>XIV</h3>
<p class="poetry">The tightness of a hempen rope<br />
Their bodies got; but laundry soap<br />
Not handsomer can rub the skin<br />
For token of the washed within.<br />
Occasionally coughers cast<br />
A leg aloft and coughed their last.</p>
<h3>XV</h3>
<p class="poetry">The weaker maids and some old men,<br />
Requiring rafters for the pen<br />
On rainy nights, were those who fell.<br />
The rest were quite a miracle,<br />
Refreshed as you may search all round<br />
On Club-feast days and cry, Not found!</p>
<h3>XVI</h3>
<p class="poetry">For these poor innocents, that slept<br />
Against the sky, soft women wept:<br />
For never did they any theft;<br />
&rsquo;Twas known when they their camping left,<br />
And jumped the cold out of their rags;<br />
In spirit rich as money-bags.</p>
<h3><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>XVII</h3>
<p class="poetry">They jumped the question, jumped reply;<br />
And whether to insist, deny,<br />
Reprove, persuade, they jumped in ranks<br />
Or singly, straight the arms to flanks,<br />
And straight the legs, with just a knee<br />
For bending in a mild degree.</p>
<h3>XVIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">The villagers might call them mad;<br />
An endless holiday they had,<br />
Of pleasure in a serious work:<br />
They taught by leaps where perils lurk,<br />
And with the lambkins practised sports<br />
For &rsquo;scaping Satan&rsquo;s pounds and quarts.</p>
<h3>XIX</h3>
<p class="poetry">It really seemed on certain days,<br />
When they bobbed up their Lord to praise,<br />
And bobbing up they caught the glance<br />
Of light, our secret is to dance,<br />
And hold the tongue from hindering peace;<br />
To dance out preacher and police.</p>
<h3>XX</h3>
<p class="poetry">Those flies of boys disturbed them sore<br />
On Sundays and when daylight wore:<br />
With withies cut from hedge or copse,<br />
They treated them as whipping-tops,<br />
And flung big stones with cruel aim;<br />
Yet all the flock jumped on the same.</p>
<h3><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>XXI</h3>
<p class="poetry">For what could persecution do<br />
To worry such a blessed crew,<br />
On whom it was as wind to fire,<br />
Which set them always jumping higher?<br />
The parson and the lawyer tried,<br />
By meek persistency defied.</p>
<h3>XXII</h3>
<p class="poetry">But if they bore, they could pursue<br />
As well, and this the Bishop too;<br />
When inner warnings proved him plain<br />
The chase for Jump-to-glory Jane.<br />
She knew it by his being sent<br />
To bless the feasting in the tent.</p>
<h3>XXIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">Not less than fifty years on end,<br />
The Squire had been the Bishop&rsquo;s friend:<br />
And his poor tenants, harmless ones,<br />
With souls to save! fed not on buns,<br />
But angry meats: she took her place<br />
Outside to show the way to grace.</p>
<h3>XXIV</h3>
<p class="poetry">In apron suit the Bishop stood;<br />
The crowding people kindly viewed.<br />
A gaunt grey woman he saw rise<br />
On air, with most beseeching eyes:<br />
And evident as light in dark<br />
It was, she set to him for mark.</p>
<h3><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>XXV</h3>
<p class="poetry">Her highest leap had come: with ease<br />
She jumped to reach the Bishop&rsquo;s knees:<br />
Compressing tight her arms and lips,<br />
She sought to jump the Bishop&rsquo;s hips:<br />
Her aim flew at his apron-band,<br />
That he might see and understand.</p>
<h3>XXVI</h3>
<p class="poetry">The mild inquiry of his gaze<br />
Was altered to a peaked amaze,<br />
At sight of thirty in ascent,<br />
To gain his notice clearly bent:<br />
And greatly Jane at heart was vexed<br />
By his ploughed look of mind perplexed.</p>
<h3>XXVII</h3>
<p class="poetry">In jumps that said, Beware the pit!<br />
More eloquent than speaking it&mdash;<br />
That said, Avoid the boiled, the roast;<br />
The heated nose on face of ghost,<br />
Which comes of drinking: up and o&rsquo;er<br />
The flesh with me! did Jane implore.</p>
<h3>XXVIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">She jumped him high as huntsmen go<br />
Across the gate; she jumped him low,<br />
To coax him to begin and feel<br />
His infant steps returning, peel<br />
His mortal pride, exposing fruit,<br />
And off with hat and apron suit.</p>
<h3><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>XXIX</h3>
<p class="poetry">We need much patience, well she knew,<br />
And out and out, and through and through,<br />
When we would gentlefolk address,<br />
However we may seek to bless:<br />
At times they hide them like the beasts<br />
From sacred beams; and mostly priests.</p>
<h3>XXX</h3>
<p class="poetry">He gave no sign of making bare,<br />
Nor she of faintness or despair.<br />
Inflamed with hope that she might win,<br />
If she but coaxed him to begin,<br />
She used all arts for making fain;<br />
The mother with her babe was Jane.</p>
<h3>XXXI</h3>
<p class="poetry">Now stamped the Squire, and knowing not<br />
Her business, waved her from the spot.<br />
Encircled by the men of might,<br />
The head of Jane, like flickering light,<br />
As in a charger, they beheld<br />
Ere she was from the park expelled.</p>
<h3>XXXII</h3>
<p class="poetry">Her grief, in jumps of earthly weight,<br />
Did Jane around communicate:<br />
For that the moment when began<br />
The holy but mistaken man,<br />
In view of light, to take his lift,<br />
They cut him from her charm adrift!</p>
<h3><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>XXXIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">And he was lost: a banished face<br />
For ever from the ways of grace,<br />
Unless pinched hard by dreams in fright.<br />
They saw the Bishop&rsquo;s wavering sprite<br />
Within her look, at come and go,<br />
Long after he had caused her woe.</p>
<h3>XXXIV</h3>
<p class="poetry">Her greying eyes (until she sank<br />
At Fredsham on the wayside bank,<br />
Like cinder heaps that whitened lie<br />
From coals that shot the flame to sky)<br />
Had glassy vacancies, which yearned<br />
For one in memory discerned.</p>
<h3>XXXV</h3>
<p class="poetry">May those who ply the tongue that cheats,<br />
And those who rush to beer and meats,<br />
And those whose mean ambition aims<br />
At palaces and titled names,<br />
Depart in such a cheerful strain<br />
As did our Jump-to-glory Jane!</p>
<h3>XXXVI</h3>
<p class="poetry">Her end was beautiful: one sigh.<br />
She jumped a foot when it was nigh.<br />
A lily in a linen clout<br />
She looked when they had laid her out.<br />
It is a lily-light she bears<br />
For England up the ladder-stairs.</p>

RIDDLE FOR MEN</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">This</span> Riddle rede or die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Says History since our Flood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To warn her sons of power:&mdash;<br />
It can be truth, it can be lie;<br />
Be parasite to twist awry;<br />
The drouthy vampire for your blood;<br />
The fountain of the silver flower;<br />
A brand, a lure, a web, a crest;<br />
Supple of wax or tempered steel;<br />
The spur to honour, snake in nest:<br />
&rsquo;Tis as you will with it to deal;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To wear upon the breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or trample under heel.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rede you not aright,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Says Nature, still in red<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall History&rsquo;s tale be writ!<br />
For solely thus you lead to light<br />
The trailing chapters she must write,<br />
And pass my fiery test of dead<br />
Or living through the furnace-pit:<br />
Dislinked from who the softer hold<br />
In grip of brute, and brute remain:<br />
Of whom the woeful tale is told,<br />
How for one short Sultanic reign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their bodies lapse to mould,<br />

SAGE ENAMOURED AND THE HONEST LADY</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">One</span> fairest of the
ripe unwedded left<br />
Her shadow on the Sage&rsquo;s path; he found,<br />
By common signs, that she had done a theft.<br />
He could have made the sovereign heights resound<br />
With questions of the wherefore of her state:<br />
He on far other but an hour before<br />
Intent.&nbsp; And was it man, or was it mate,<br />
That she disdained? or was there haply more?</p>
<p class="poetry">About her mouth a placid humour slipped<br />
The dimple, as you see smooth lakes at eve<br />
Spread melting rings where late a swallow dipped.<br />
The surface was attentive to receive,<br />
The secret underneath enfolded fast.<br />
She had the step of the unconquered, brave,<br />
Not arrogant; and if the vessel&rsquo;s mast<br />
Waved liberty, no challenge did it wave.<br />
Her eyes were the sweet world desired of souls,<br />
With something of a wavering line unspelt.<br />
They hold the look whose tenderness condoles<br />
For what the sister in the look has dealt<br />
Of fatal beyond healing; and her tones<br />
A woman&rsquo;s honeyed amorous outvied,<br />
As when in a dropped viol the wood-throb moans<br />
Among the sobbing strings, that plain and chide<br />
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Like
infants for themselves, less deep to thrill<br />
Than those rich mother-notes for them breathed round.<br />
Those voices are not magic of the will<br />
To strike love&rsquo;s wound, but of love&rsquo;s wound give
sound,<br />
Conveying it; the yearnings, pains and dreams.<br />
They waft to the moist tropics after storm,<br />
When out of passion spent thick incense steams,<br />
And jewel-belted clouds the wreck transform.</p>
<p class="poetry">Was never hand on brush or lyre to paint<br />
Her gracious manners, where the nuptial ring<br />
Of melody clasped motion in restraint:<br />
The reed-blade with the breeze thereof may sing.<br />
With such endowments armed was she and decked<br />
To make her spoken thoughts eclipse her kind;<br />
Surpassing many a giant intellect,<br />
The marvel of that cradled infant mind.<br />
It clenched the tiny fist, it curled the toe;<br />
Cherubic laughed, enticed, dispensed, absorbed;<br />
And promised in fair feminine to grow<br />
A Sage&rsquo;s match and mate, more heavenly orbed.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">Across his path the spouseless Lady cast<br />
Her shadow, and the man that thing became.<br />
His youth uprising called his age the Past.<br />
This was the strong grey head of laurelled name,<br />
And in his bosom an inverted Sage<br />
Mistook for light of morn the light which sank.<br />
But who while veins run blood shall know the page<br />
Succeeding ere we turn upon our blank?<br />
Comes Beauty with her tale of moon and cloud,<br />
Her silvered rims of mystery pointing in<br />
To hollows of the half-veiled unavowed,<br />
Where beats her secret life, grey heads will spin<br />
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Quick as
the young, and spell those hieroglyphs<br />
Of phosphorescent dusk, devoutly bent;<br />
They drink a cup to whirl on dizzier cliffs<br />
For their shamed fall, which asks, why was she sent!<br />
Why, and of whom, and whence; and tell they truth,<br />
The legends of her mission to beguile?</p>
<p class="poetry">Hard likeness to the toilful apes of youth<br
/>
He bore at times, and tempted the sly smile;<br />
And not on her soft lips was it descried.<br />
She stepped her way benevolently grave:<br />
Nor sign that Beauty fed her worm of pride,<br />
By tossing victim to the courtier knave,<br />
Let peep, nor of the naughty pride gave sign.<br />
Rather &rsquo;twas humbleness in being pursued,<br />
As pilgrim to the temple of a shrine.<br />
Had he not wits to pierce the mask he wooed?<br />
All wisdom&rsquo;s armoury this man could wield;<br />
And if the cynic in the Sage it pleased<br />
Traverse her woman&rsquo;s curtain and poor shield,<br />
For new example of a world diseased;<br />
Showing her shrineless, not a temple, bare;<br />
A curtain ripped to tatters by the blast;<br />
Yet she most surely to this man stood fair:<br />
He worshipped like the young enthusiast,<br />
Named simpleton or poet.&nbsp; Did he read<br />
Right through, and with the voice she held reserved<br />
Amid her vacant ruins jointly plead?</p>

But, ah! confession of a woman&rsquo;s breast:<br />
She eminent, she honoured of her sex!<br />
Truth speaks, and takes the spots of the confessed,<br />
To veil them.&nbsp; None of women, save their vile,<br />
Plays traitor to an army in the field.<br />
The cries most vindicating most defile.<br />
How shall a cause to Nature be appealed,<br />
When, under pressure of their common foe,<br />
Her sisters shun the Mother and disown,<br />
On pain of his intolerable crow<br />
Above the fiction, built for him, o&rsquo;erthrown?<br />
Irrational he is, irrational<br />
Must they be, though not Reason&rsquo;s light shall wane<br />
In them with ever Nature at close call,<br />
Behind the fiction torturing to sustain;<br />
Who hear her in the milk, and sometimes make<br />
A tongueless answer, shivered on a sigh:<br />
Whereat men dread their lofty structure&rsquo;s quake<br />
Once more, and in their hosts for tocsin ply<br />
The crazy roar of peril, leonine<br />
For injured majesty.&nbsp; That sigh of dames<br />
Is rare and soon suppressed.&nbsp; Not they combine<br />
To shake the structure sheltering them, which tames<br />
Their lustier if not wilder: fixed are they,<br />
In elegancy scarce denoting ease;<br />
And do they breathe, it is not to betray<br />
The martyr in the caryatides.<br />
Yet here and there along the graceful row<br />
Is one who fetches breath from deeps, who deems,<br />
Moved by a desperate craving, their old foe<br />
May yield a trustier friend than woman seems,<br />
And aid to bear the sculptured floral weight<br />
Massed upon heads not utterly of stone:<br />
May stamp endurance by expounding fate.<br />

Thing that had throbbed ere shot black lightning through.<br />

A headless figure folding a cleft urn,<br />

<p class="poetry">So spake she her first utterance on the

It softened torment, in the funeral hues<br />
Round wan Romance at ebb, but drove her back<br />
To listen to herself, herself accuse<br />
Harshly as Love&rsquo;s imperial cause allowed.<br />
She meant to grovel, and her lover praised<br />
So high o&rsquo;er the condemnatory crowd,<br />
That she perforce a fellow phoenix blazed.</p>
<p class="poetry">The picture was of hand fast joined to hand,<br

And two drowned shorecasts, who, for the life esteemed<br />
Above their lost, invoke an advocate<br />
In Passion&rsquo;s purity, thereby redeemed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Redeemed, uplifted, glimmering on a throne,<br

The woman stricken by an arrow falls.<br />
His advocate she can be, not her own,<br />
If, Traitress to thy sex! one sister calls.<br />

Her charge of counter-motives, none impure:<br />
But muteness whipped her skin.&nbsp; She could have said,<br />
Her free confession was to work his cure,<br />
Show proofs for why she could not love or wed.<br />
Were they not shown?&nbsp; His muteness shook in thrall<br />
Her body on the verge of that black pit<br />

Heard Life subsiding on the eternal hum:<br />
Welcome to women, when, between man&rsquo;s laws<br />
And Nature&rsquo;s thirsts, they, soul from body torn,<br />
Give suck at breast to a celestial cause,<br />
Named by the mouth infernal, and forsworn.<br />

To think the cure so manifest, so frail<br />
Her charm remaining.&nbsp; Was the curtain&rsquo;s rent<br />
Too wide? he but a man of that herd male?<br />
She saw him as that herd of the forked head<br />
Butting the woman harrowed on her knees,<br />
Clothed only in life&rsquo;s last devouring red.<br />
Confession at her fearful instant sees<br />

In letters of the skeleton: at once,<br />
Swayed on the supplication of her act,<br />
The rabble reading, roaring to denounce,<br />
She joins.&nbsp; No longer colouring, with skips<br />
At tangles, picture that for eyes in tears<br />
Might swim the sequence, she addressed her lips<br />
To do the scaffold&rsquo;s office at his ears.</p>
<p class="poetry">Into the bitter judgement of that herd<br />
On women, she, deeming it present, fell.<br />
Her frenzy of abasement hugged the word<br />
They stone with, and so pile their citadel<br />
To launch at outcasts the foul levin bolt.<br />
As had he flung it, in her breast it burned.<br />
Face and reflect it did her hot revolt<br />
From hardness, to the writhing rebel turned;<br />
Because the golden buckler was withheld,<br />
She to herself applies the powder-spark,<br />
For joy of one wild demon burst ere quelled,<br />
Perishing to astound the tyrant Dark.</p>

With execration of her daughters&rsquo; lures.<br />
They help him the proud fortress to defend,<br />
Nor see what front it wears, what life immures,<br />
The murder it commits; nor that its base<br />
Is shifty as a huckster&rsquo;s opening deal<br />
For bargain under smoothest market face,<br />

IN MEMORY</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Days</span>, when the ball
of our vision<br />
Had eagles that flew unabashed to sun;<br />
When the grasp on the bow was decision,<br />
And arrow and hand and eye were one;<br />
When the Pleasures, like waves to a swimmer,<br />
Came heaving for rapture ahead!&mdash;<br />
Invoke them, they dwindle, they glimmer<br />
As lights over mounds of the dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">Behold the winged Olympus, off the mead,<br />
With thunder of wide pinions, lightning speed,<br />
Wafting the shepherd-boy through ether clear,<br />
To bear the golden nectar-cup.<br />
So flies desire at view of its delight,<br />
When the young heart is tiptoe perched on sight.<br />
We meanwhile who in hues of the sick year<br />
The Spring-time paint to prick us for our lost,<br />
Mount but the fatal half way up&mdash;<br />
Whereon shut eyes!&nbsp; This is decreed,<br />
For Age that would to youthful heavens ascend,<br />
By passion for the arms&rsquo; possession tossed,<br />
It falls the way of sighs and hath their end;<br />
A spark gone out to more sepulchral night.<br />
Good if the arrowy eagle of the height<br />
Be then the little bird that hops to feed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lame falls the cry to kindle days<br />
Of radiant orb and daring gaze.<br />
It does but clank our mortal chain.<br />
For Earth reads through her felon old<br />

And would be thieves of treasure spent,<br />
With their grey season soured.<br />
She could write out their history in their thirst<br />
To have again the much devoured,<br />
And be the bud at burst;<br />
In honey fancy join the flow,<br />
Where Youth swims on as once they went,<br />
All choiric for spontaneous glee<br />
Of active eager lungs and thews;<br />
They now bared roots beside the river bent;<br />
Whose privilege themselves to see;<br />
Their place in yonder tideway know;<br />
The current glass peruse;<br />
The depths intently sound;<br />
And sapped by each returning flood<br />
Accept for monitory nourishment<br />
Those worn roped features under crust of mud,<br />
Reflected in the silvery smooth around:<br />
Not less the branching and high singing tree,<br />
A home of nests, a landmark and a tent,<br />
Until their hour for losing hold on ground.<br />
Even such good harvest of the things that flee<br />
Earth offers her subjected, and they choose<br />
Rather of Bacchic Youth one beam to drink,<br />
And warm slow marrow with the sensual wink.<br />
So block they at her source the Mother of the Muse.</p>
<p class="poetry">Who cheerfully the little bird becomes,<br />
Without a fall, and pipes for peck at crumbs,<br />
May have her dolings to the lightest touch;<br />
As where some cripple muses by his crutch,<br />
Unwitting that the spirit in him sings:<br />
&lsquo;When I had legs, then had I wings,<br />
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>As good as
any born of eggs,<br />
To feed on all a&euml;rial things,<br />
When I had legs!&rsquo;<br />
And if not to embrace he sighs,<br />
She gives him breath of Youth awhile,<br />
Perspective of a breezy mile,<br />
Companionable hedgeways, lifting skies;<br />
Scenes where his nested dreams upon their hoard<br />
Brooded, or up to empyrean soared:<br />
Enough to link him with a dotted line.<br />
But cravings for an eagle&rsquo;s flight,<br />
To top white peaks and serve wild wine<br />
Among the rosy undecayed,<br />
Bring only flash of shade<br />
From her full throbbing breast of day in night.<br />
By what they crave are they betrayed:<br />
And cavernous is that young dragon&rsquo;s jaw,<br />
Crimson for all the fiery reptile saw<br />
In time now coveted, for teeth to flay,<br />
Once more consume, were Life recurrent May.<br />
They to their moment of drawn breath,<br />
Which is the life that makes the death,<br />
The death that makes ethereal life would bind:<br />
The death that breeds the spectre do they find.<br />
Darkness is wedded and the waste regrets<br />
Beating as dead leaves on a fitful gust,<br />
By souls no longer dowered to climb<br />
Beneath their pack of dust,<br />
Whom envy of a lustrous prime,<br />
Eclipsed while yet invoked, besets,<br />
And dooms to sink and water sable flowers,<br />
That never gladdened eye or loaded bee.<br />
Strain we the arms for Memory&rsquo;s hours,<br />
We are the seized Persephone.<br />
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Responsive
never to the soft desire<br />
For one prized tune is this our chord of life.<br />
&rsquo;Tis clipped to deadness with a wanton knife,<br />
In wishes that for ecstasies aspire.<br />
Yet have we glad companionship of Youth,<br />
Elysian meadows for the mind,<br />
Dare we to face deeds done, and in our tomb<br />
Filled with the parti-coloured bloom<br />
Of loved and hated, grasp all human truth<br />
Sowed by us down the mazy paths behind.<br />
To feel that heaven must we that hell sound through:<br />
Whence comes a line of continuity,<br />
That brings our middle station into view,<br />
Between those poles; a novel Earth we see,<br />
In likeness of us, made of banned and blest;<br />
The sower&rsquo;s bed, but not the reaper&rsquo;s rest:<br />
An Earth alive with meanings, wherein meet<br />
Buried, and breathing, and to be.<br />
Then of the junction of the three,<br />
Even as a heart in brain, full sweet<br />
May sense of soul, the sum of music, beat.</p>
<p class="poetry">Only the soul can walk the dusty track<br />
Where hangs our flowering under vapours black,<br />
And bear to see how these pervade, obscure,<br />
Quench recollection of a spacious pure.<br />
They take phantasmal forms, divide, convolve,<br />
Hard at each other point and gape,<br />
Horrible ghosts! in agony dissolve,<br />
To reappear with one they drape<br />
For criminal, and, Father! shrieking name,<br />
Who such distorted issue did beget.<br />
Accept them, them and him, though hiss thy sweat<br />
Off brow on breast, whose furnace flame<br />
Has eaten, and old Self consumes.<br />
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Out of the
purification will they leap,<br />
Thee renovating while new light illumes<br />
The dusky web of evil, known as pain,<br />
That heavily up healthward mounts the steep;<br />
Our fleshly road to beacon-fire of brain:<br />
Midway the tameless oceanic brute<br />
Below, whose heave is topped with foam for fruit,<br />
And the fair heaven reflecting inner peace<br />
On righteous warfare, that asks not to cease.</p>
<p class="poetry">Forth of such passage through black fire we
win<br />
Clear hearing of the simple lute,<br />
Whereon, and not on other, Memory plays<br />
For them who can in quietness receive<br />
Her restorative airs: a ditty thin<br />
As note of hedgerow bird in ear of eve,<br />
Or wave at ebb, the shallow catching rays<br />
On a transparent sheet, where curves a glass<br />
To truer heavens than when the breaker neighs<br />
Loud at the plunge for bubbly wreck in roar.<br />
Solidity and bulk and martial brass,<br />
Once tyrants of the senses, faintly score<br />
A mark on pebbled sand or fluid slime,<br />
While present in the spirit, vital there,<br />
Are things that seemed the phantoms of their time;<br />
Eternal as the recurrent cloud, as air<br />
Imperative, refreshful as dawn-dew.<br />
Some evanescent hand on vapour scrawled<br />
Historic of the soul, and heats anew<br />
Its coloured lines where deeds of flesh stand bald.<br />
True of the man, and of mankind &rsquo;tis true,<br />
Did we stout battle with the Shade, Despair,<br />
Our cowardice, it blooms; or haply warred<br />
Against the primal beast in us, and flung;<br />
Or cleaving mists of Sorrow, left it starred<br />
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Above
self-pity slain: or it was Prayer<br />
First taken for Life&rsquo;s cleanser; or the tongue<br />
Spake for the world against this heart; or rings<br />
Old laughter, from the founts of wisdom sprung;<br />
Or clap of wing of joy, that was a throb<br />
From breast of Earth, and did no creature rob:<br />
These quickening live.&nbsp; But deepest at her springs,<br />
Most filial, is an eye to love her young.<br />
And had we it, to see with it, alive<br />
Is our lost garden, flower, bird and hive.<br />
Blood of her blood, aim of her aim, are then<br />
The green-robed and grey-crested sons of men:<br />
She tributary to her aged restores<br />
The living in the dead; she will inspire<br />
Faith homelier than on the Yonder shores,<br />
Abhorring these as mire,<br />
Uncertain steps, in dimness gropes,<br />
With mortal tremours pricking hopes,<br />
And, by the final Bacchic of the lusts<br />
Propelled, the Bacchic of the spirit trusts:<br />
A fervour drunk from mystic hierophants;<br />
Not utterly misled, though blindly led,<br />
Led round fermenting eddies.&nbsp; Faith she plants<br />
In her own firmness as our midway road:<br />
Which rightly Youth has read, though blindly read;<br />
Her essence reading in her toothsome goad;<br />
Spur of bright dreams experience disenchants.<br />
But love we well the young, her road midway<br />
The darknesses runs consecrated clay.<br />
Despite our feeble hold on this green home,<br />
And the vast outer strangeness void of dome,<br />
Shall we be with them, of them, taught to feel,<br />
Up to the moment of our prostrate fall,<br />
The life they deem voluptuously real<br />
Is more than empty echo of a call,<br />
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Or shadow
of a shade, or swing of tides;<br />
As brooding upon age, when veins congeal,<br />
Grey palsy nods to think.&nbsp; With us for guides,<br />
Another step above the animal,<br />
To views in Alpine thought are they helped on.<br />
Good if so far we live in them when gone!</p>
<p class="poetry">And there the arrowy eagle of the height<br />
Becomes the little bird that hops to feed,<br />
Glad of a crumb, for tempered appetite<br />
To make it wholesome blood and fruitful seed.<br />
Then Memory strikes on no slack string,<br />
Nor sectional will varied Life appear:<br />
Perforce of soul discerned in mind, we hear<br />
Earth with her Onward chime, with Winter Spring.<br />
And ours the mellow note, while sharing joys<br />
No more subjecting mortals who have learnt<br />
To build for happiness on equipoise,<br />
The Pleasures read in sparks of substance burnt;<br />
Know in our seasons an integral wheel,<br />
That rolls us to a mark may yet be willed.<br />
This, the truistic rubbish under heel<br />
Of all the world, we peck at and are filled.</p>

A frosted night had opened May:<br />
And on that plumed and armoured night,<br />
As one close temple hove our wood,<br />
Its border leafage virgin white.<br />
Remote down air an owl hallooed.<br />
The black twig dropped without a twirl;<br />
The bud in jewelled grasp was nipped;<br />
The brown leaf cracked a scorching curl;<br />
A crystal off the green leaf slipped.<br />
Across the tracks of rimy tan,<br />
Some busy thread at whiles would shoot;<br />
A limping minnow-rillet ran,<br />
To hang upon an icy foot.</p>
<p class="poetry">In this shrill hush of quietude,<br />
The ear conceived a severing cry.<br />
Almost it let the sound elude,<br />
When chuckles three, a warble shy,<br />
From hazels of the garden came,<br />
Near by the crimson-windowed farm.<br />
They laid the trance on breath and frame,<br />
A prelude of the passion-charm.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then soon was heard, not sooner heard<br />

Voice of an Eden in the bird<br />
Renewing with his pipe of four<br />

In throb of heart: unnumbered throats<br />
Flung upward at a fountain&rsquo;s pitch,<br />

That on the fountain&rsquo;s pool subside,<br />
Exult and ruffle and upspring:<br />
Endless the crossing multiplied<br />
Of silver and of golden string.<br />
There chimed a bubbled underbrew<br />
With witch-wild spray of vocal dew.</p>
<p class="poetry">It seemed a single harper swept<br />
Our wild wood&rsquo;s inner chords and waked<br />
A spirit that for yearning ached<br />
Ere men desired and joyed or wept.<br />
Or now a legion ravishing<br />
Musician rivals did unite<br />
In love of sweetness high to sing<br />
The subtle song that rivals light;<br />
From breast of earth to breast of sky:<br />
And they were secret, they were nigh:<br />
A hand the magic might disperse;<br />
The magic swung my universe.</p>

Churned, gurgled, spouted, interflashed,<br />
Nor either was the one we know:<br />

Caught up our earth to some mid-height<br />
Of double life to ear and sight,<br />
She giving voice to thought that shines<br />
Keen-brilliant of her deepest mines;<br />
While steely drips the rillet clinked,<br />

Those issue notes, I must review<br />
What serious breath the woodland drew;<br />
The low throb of expectancy;<br />

Unseen of her attendant nymphs; none knew.<br />
Forthwith the creature to his fellows drew,<br />
And looking backward on the curtained path,<br />
He strove to tell; he could but heave a breast<br />
Too full, and point to mouth, with failing leers:<br />
Vainly he danced for speech, he giggled tears,<br />
Made as if torn in two, as if tight pressed,<br />
As if cast prone; then fetching whimpered tunes<br />
For words, flung heel and set his hairy flight<br />
Through forest-hollows, over rocky height.<br />

With dreams of ease whereof the soul pays price!<br />

Pledged to the heavens for safety of their land.<br />

And where his tide of nourishment he drives,<br />

He is the yellow crops, the rounded limbs,<br />
The Past yet flowing, the fair time that fills;<br />
Breath of all mouths and grist of many mills.<br />
To-morrow, warning none with tempest-showers,<br />
He is the vast Insensate who devours<br />
His golden promise over leagues of seed,<br />
Then sits in a smooth lake upon the deed.<br />
The races which on barbarous force begin<br />
Inherit onward of their origin,<br />
And cancelled blessings will the current length<br />
Reveal till they know need of shaping strength.<br />
&rsquo;Tis not in men to recognize the need<br />
Before they clash in hosts, in hosts they bleed.<br />
Then may sharp suffering their nature grind;<br />
Of rabble passions grow the chieftain Mind.<br />
Yet mark where still broad Nile boasts thousands fed,<br />
For tens up the safe mountains at his head.<br />

While overhead in ordered set and rise<br />
Her kingly crowns immutably defiled;<br />
Effulgent on funereal piled<br />
Across the vacant heavens, and distrained<br />
Her body, mutely, even as earth, to bear;<br />

<p class="poetry">Through marching scores of winters racked she
lay,<br />
Beneath a hoar-frost&rsquo;s brilliant crust,<br />
Whereon the jewelled flies that drained<br />

Beneath it read.<br />
Athirst to kiss, athirst to slay, she stood,<br />
A radiance fringed with grim affright;<br />

There ramped the lion, here entrailed the snake.<br />

In the mother&rsquo;s fears, and in young Liberty&rsquo;s wail<br

Alarmed, for her encompassed children&rsquo;s sake,<br />

Receptive or profuse, were fires he lacked,<br />
Whose marrow had expelled their wasteful sparks;<br />
Whose mind, the vast machine of endless haste,<br />
Took up but solids for its glowing seal.<br />
The hungry love, that fish-like creatures feel,<br />
Impelled for prize of hooks, for prey of sharks,<br />

A head that held an Europe half devoured<br />

Nought save his rounding aim, the means he plied,<br />
Death for his cause, to him could point appeal.<br />
His mistress was the thing of uses tried.<br />
Frigid the netting smile on whom he wooed,<br />
But on his Policy his eye was lewd.<br />
That sharp long zig-zag into distance brooked<br />
No foot across; a shade his ire provoked.<br />
The blunder or the cruelty of a deed<br />
His Policy imperative could plead.<br />
He deemed nought other precious, nor knew he<br />
Legitimate outside his Policy.<br />
Men&rsquo;s lives and works were due, from their birth&rsquo;s
date,<br />
To the State&rsquo;s shield and sword, himself the State.<br />
He thought for them in mass, as Titan may;<br />
For their pronounced well-being bade obey;<br />
O&rsquo;er each obstructive thicket thunderclapped,<br />
And straight their easy road to market mapped.<br />

At sign of motion; yet his brows were murk,<br />
His gorge would surge, to see the butcher&rsquo;s work,<br />
The Reaper&rsquo;s field; a sensitive in nerves.<br />
He rode not over men to do them hurt.<br />
As one who claimed to have for paramour<br />
Earth&rsquo;s fairest form, he dealt the cancelling blow;<br />
Impassioned, still impersonal; to ensure<br />
Possession; free of rivals, not their foe.</p>
<p class="poetry">The common Tyrant&rsquo;s frenzies, rancour,

He knew as little as men&rsquo;s claim on rights.<br />
A kindness for old servants, early friends,<br />
Was constant in him while they served his ends;<br />
And if irascible, &rsquo;twas the moment&rsquo;s reek<br />
From fires diverted by some gusty freak.<br />
His Policy the act which breeds the act<br />
Prevised, in issues accurately summed<br />
From reckonings of men&rsquo;s tempers, terrors, needs:&mdash;<br

That universal army, which he leads<br />
Who builds Imperial on Imperious Fact.<br />

A thousand furious wheels at whirr, untired<br />

The mighty bird of sky minutest grains<br />

In humankind diversities of masks,<br />

For Order&rsquo;s cause he laboured, as inclined<br />
A soldier&rsquo;s training and his Euclid mind.<br />
His army unto men he could present<br />
As model of the perfect instrument.<br />
That creature, woman, was the sofa soft,<br />
When warriors their dusty armour doffed,<br />
And read their manuals for the making truce<br />
With rosy frailties framed to reproduce.<br />
He farmed his land, distillingly alive<br />
For the utmost extract he might have and hive,<br />
Wherewith to marshal force; and in like scheme,<br />

The friable and the grumous, dizzards both.<br />
Men were good sticks his mastery wrought from hoops;<br />
Some serviceable, none credible on oath.<br />
The silly preference they nursed to die<br />
In beds he scorned, and led where they should lie.<br />
If magic made them pliable for his use,<br />
Magician he could be by planned surprise.<br />
For do they see the deuce in human guise,<br />
As men&rsquo;s acknowledged head appears the deuce,<br />
And they will toil with devilish craft and zeal.<br />
Among them certain vagrant wits that had<br />
Ideas buzzed; they were the feebly mad;<br />
Pursuers of a film they hailed ideal;<br />
But could be dangerous fire-flies for a brain<br />
Subdued by fact, still amorous of the inane.<br />

Hull down, with masts against the Western hues.</p>

The lightnings and the locusts, plagues of blight,<br />
Plagues of the revel: they were Deluge rain,<br />
And dreaded Conflagration; lawless Might.<br />
Death writes a reeling line along the snows,<br />
Where under frozen mists they may be tracked,<br />
Who men and elements provoked to foes,<br />
And Gods: they were of god and beast compact:<br />
Abhorred of all.&nbsp; Yet, how they sucked the teats<br />
Of Carnage, thirsty issue of their dam,<br />
Whose eagles, angrier than their oriflamme,<br />
Flushed the vext earth with blood, green earth forgets.<br />
The gay young generations mask her grief;<br />
Where bled her children hangs the loaded sheaf.<br />
Forgetful is green earth; the Gods alone<br />
Remember everlastingly: they strike<br />
Remorselessly, and ever like for like.<br />
By their great memories the Gods are known.</p>

Unsparing even as they to furrow up<br />

Of crested vanity shed graceful nods:<br />
Transcendent in her foundries, Arts and looms,<br />

Hugged him to reedy helplessness despite<br />

For he had eyed them nearing him in play,<br />
The giant cubs, who gambolled and who snarled,<br />
Unheeding his fell presence, by the mount<br />
Ossa, beside a brushwood cavern; there<br />
On Earth&rsquo;s original fisticuffs they called<br />
For ease of sharp dispute: whereat the God,<br />
Approving, deemed that sometime trained to arms,<br />

Like music of the very Muse.<br />
Great artists pass our single sense;<br />
We hear in seeing, strung to tense;<br />
Then haply marvel, groan mayhap,<br />
To think such beauty means a trap.<br />
But Nature&rsquo;s genius, even man&rsquo;s<br />
At best, is practical in plans;<br />
Subservient to the needy thought,<br />
However rare the weapon wrought.<br />
As long as Nature holds it good<br />
To urge her creatures&rsquo; quest for food<br />
Will beauty stamp the just intent<br />
Of weapons upon service bent.<br />
For beauty is a flower of roots<br />
Embedded lower than our boots;<br />
Out of the primal strata springs,<br />
And shows for crown of useful things.</p>

Before the leader foot shall dip in stream:<br />
One arm at curve along a rounded thigh;<br />
Her firm new breasts each pointing its own way<br />
A knee half bent to shade its fellow shy,<br />
Where innocence, not nature, signals nay.<br />

Still is she unaware she wakens thirst.</p>

Sob of our ripened blood for its next breath:<br />
Her wily semblance nought of her denies;<br />
Seems it the Goddess runs, the Goddess hies,<br />
The generous Goddess yields.&nbsp; And she can arm<br />
Her dwarfed and twisted with her secret charm;<br />
Benevolent as Earth to feed her own.<br />
Fully shall they be fed, if they beseech.<br />
But scorn she has for them that walk alone;<br />
Blanched men, starved women, whom no arts can pleach.<br />
The men as chief of criminals she disdains,<br />

Dead on her heart her crimsoned flower of Spring.<br />
These, the irreverent of Life&rsquo;s design,<br />
Division between natural and divine<br />
Would cast; these vaunting barrenness for best,<br />
In veins of gathered strength Life&rsquo;s tide arrest;<br />

What undermines the race who mount the rose;<br />

Enkindled by persuasion overpowers:<br />
Why weak as are her frailer trailing weeds,<br />
The strong when Beauty gleams o&rsquo;er Nature&rsquo;s needs,<br

And timely guile unguarded finds them lie.<br />
They who her sway withstand a sea defy,<br />
At every point of juncture must be proof;<br />
Nor look for mercy from the incessant surge<br />
Her forces mixed of craft and passion urge<br />
For the one whelming wave to spring aloof.<br />
She, tenderness, is pitiless to them<br />
Resisting in her godhead nature&rsquo;s truth.<br />
No flower their face shall be, but writhen stem;<br />

<p class="poetry">The foes that in repulsion never ceased,<br />
Must he, who once has been the goodly beast<br />
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Of one

Constrain to make him serviceable man;<br />
Offending neither, nor the natural claim<br />
Each pressed, denying, for his true man&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, what a sweat of anguish in that strife<br

To hold them fast conjoined within him still;<br />
Submissive to his will<br />
Along the road of life!<br />
And marvel not he wavered if at whiles<br />
The forward step met frowns, the backward smiles.<br />
For Pleasure witched him her sweet cup to drain;<br />
Repentance offered ecstasy in pain.<br />
Delicious licence called it Nature&rsquo;s cry;<br />
Ascetic rigours crushed the fleshly sigh;<br />
A tread on shingle timed his lame advance<br />
Flung as the die of Bacchanalian Chance,<br />
He of the troubled marching army leaned<br />
On godhead visible, on godhead screened;<br />
The radiant roseate, the curtained white;<br />
Yet sharp his battle strained through day, through night.</p>
<p class="poetry">He drank of fictions, till celestial aid<br />
Might seem accorded when he fawned and prayed;<br />
Sagely the generous Giver circumspect,<br />
To choose for grants the egregious, his elect;<br />
And ever that imagined succour slew<br />
The soul of brotherhood whence Reverence drew.</p>
<p class="poetry">In fellowship religion has its founts:<br />
The solitary his own God reveres:<br />
Ascend no sacred Mounts<br />
Our hungers or our fears.<br />
<a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>As only
for the numbers Nature&rsquo;s care<br />
Is shown, and she the personal nothing heeds,<br />
So to Divinity the spring of prayer<br />
From brotherhood the one way upward leads.<br />
Like the sustaining air<br />
Are both for flowers and weeds.<br />
But he who claims in spirit to be flower,<br />
Will find them both an air that doth devour.</p>
<p class="poetry">Whereby he smelt his treason, who implored<br
/>
External gifts bestowed but on the sword;<br />
Beheld himself, with less and less disguise,<br />
Through those blood-cataracts which dimmed his eyes,<br />
His army&rsquo;s foe, condemned to strive and fail;<br />
See a black adversary&rsquo;s ghost prevail;<br />
Never, though triumphs hailed him, hope to win<br />
While still the conflict tore his breast within.</p>
<p class="poetry">Out of that agony, misread for those<br />
Imprisoned Powers warring unappeased,<br />
The ghost of his black adversary rose,<br />
To smother light, shut heaven, show earth diseased.<br />
And long with him was wrestling ere emerged<br />
A mind to read in him the reflex shade<br />
Of its fierce torment; this way, that way urged;<br />
By craven compromises hourly swayed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Crouched as a nestling, still its wings
untried,<br />
The man&rsquo;s mind opened under weight of cloud.<br />
To penetrate the dark was it endowed;<br />
Stood day before a vision shooting wide.<br />
Whereat the spectral enemy lost form;<br />
The traversed wilderness exposed its track.<br />
He felt the far advance in looking back;<br />
Thence trust in his foot forward through the storm.</p>

Earth nerved her chastened son to hail athwart<br />
All ventures perilous his shrouded Sire;<br />
A stranger still, religiously divined;<br />
Not yet with understanding read aright.<br />
But when the mind, the cherishable mind,<br />
The multitude&rsquo;s grave shepherd, took full flight,<br />
Himself as mirror raised among his kind,<br />
He saw, and first of brotherhood had sight:<br />
Knew that his force to fly, his will to see,<br />
His heart enlarged beyond its ribbed domain,<br />
Had come of many a grip in mastery,<br />
Which held conjoined the hostile rival twain,<br />
And of his bosom made him lord, to keep<br />
The starry roof of his unruffled frame<br />
Awake to earth, to heaven, and plumb the deep<br />
Below, above, aye with a wistful aim.</p>
<p class="poetry">The mastering mind in him, by tempests

By traitor inmates baited, upward burned;<br />

In wilderness, where bitter was his need:<br />
To whom in blindness, as an earthy seed<br />
For light and air, he struck through crimson mire.<br />
But not ere he upheld a forehead lamp,<br />
And viewed an army, once the seeming doomed,<br />
All choral in its fruitful garden camp,<br />
The spiritual the palpable illumed.</p>

it is a warfare but begun;<br />
Unending; with no Power to interpose;<br />
No prayer, save for strength to keep his ground,<br />
Heard of the Highest; never battle&rsquo;s close,<br />
The victory complete and victor crowned:<br />
Nor solace in defeat, save from that sense<br />
Of strength well spent, which is the strength renewed.<br />
In manhood must he find his competence;<br />
In his clear mind the spiritual food:<br />
God being there while he his fight maintains;<br />
Throughout his mind the Master Mind being there,<br />
While he rejects the suicide despair;<br />
Accepts the spur of explicable pains;<br />
Obedient to Nature, not her slave:<br />
Her lord, if to her rigid laws he bows;<br />
Her dust, if with his conscience he plays knave,<br />
And bids the Passions on the Pleasures browse:&mdash;<br />
Whence Evil in a world unread before;<br />
That mystery to simple springs resolved.<br />
His God the Known, diviner to adore,<br />
Shows Nature&rsquo;s savage riddles kindly solved.<br />
Inconscient, insensitive, she reigns<br />
In iron laws, though rapturous fair her face.<br />
Back to the primal brute shall he retrace<br />
His path, doth he permit to force her chains<br />
A soft Persuader coursing through his veins,<br />
An icy Huntress stringing to the chase:<br />

What one so gives it grace.</p>

A splendid bloodless knight to gain the skies,<br />
A blood-hot son of Earth by all her signs,<br />

With him enwound, his brave ambition hers:<br />
By him humaner made; by his keen spurs<br />
Pricked to race past the pride in giant limb,<br />
Her crazy adoration of big thews,<br />
Proud in her primal sons, when crags they hurled,<br />
Were thunder spitting lightnings on the world<br />
In daily deeds, and she their evening Muse.</p>
<p class="poetry">This man, this hero, works not to destroy;<br

Creative; in his edifice has joy.<br />
How strength may serve for purity is shown<br />
When he himself can scourge to make it clean.<br />
Withal his pitch of pride would not disown<br />
A sober world that walks the balanced mean<br />
Between its tempters, rarely overthrown:<br />
And such at times his army&rsquo;s march has been.</p>

And that way seems he bound; that way the road,<br />
With his dark-lantern mind, unled, alone,<br />
Wearifully through forest-tracts unsown,<br />
He travels, urged by some internal goad.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dares he behold the thing he is, what thing<br

Astir, demanding birth to light and wing;<br />
For battle prompt, by pleasure unbeguiled.<br />
So moves he forth in faith, if he has made<br />
His mind God&rsquo;s temple, dedicate to truth.<br />
Earth&rsquo;s nourishing delights, no more gainsaid,<br />
He tastes, as doth the bridegroom rich in youth.<br />
Then knows he Love, that beckons and controls;<br />

May not his aspect, like her own so fair<br />
Reflexively, the central force belie,<br />
And he, the once wild ocean storming sky,<br />
Be rebel at the core?&nbsp; What hope is there?</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis that in each recovery he
preserves,<br />
Between his upper and his nether wit,<br />
Sense of his march ahead, more brightly lit;<br />
He less the shaken thing of lusts and nerves;<br />
With such a grasp upon his brute as tells<br />
Of wisdom from that vile relapsing spun.<br />
A Sun goes down in wasted fire, a Sun<br />
Resplendent springs, to faith refreshed compels.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Which those two held as breath of common air;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hands of whom were given in bond elsewhere;<br

Whom Honour was untroubled to restrain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Midway the road of our life&rsquo;s term they
met,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And one another knew without surprise;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor cared that beauty stood in mutual eyes;<br />
Nor at their tardy meeting nursed regret.</p>
<p class="poetry">To them it was revealed how they had found<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; The kindred nature and the needed mind;<br />

Across the narrow plank&mdash;he could abjure.</p>

Beyond all earthly known to them who wed.</p>
<p class="poetry">So has there come the gust at South-west

Incomplete, were the light for which he dies,<br />
Less like joy of the dove that wings to nest.</p>

Life&rsquo;s full throb over breathless and abased:<br />
Yet stand they, though impalpable the links,<br />
One, more one than the bridally embraced.</p>

Pledged to the combat; they unto me have in nowise a harm
done;<br />
Never have they, of a truth, come lifting my horses or oxen;<br

Never in deep-soiled Phthia, the nurser of heroes, my harvests<br

Achaians<br />
Gave some flourishing populous Trojan town up to pillage.<br />
Nay, sure, mine were the hands did most in the storm of the
combat,<br />
Yet when came peradventure share of the booty amongst us,<br />
Bigger to thee went the prize, while I some small bless&egrave;d
thing bore<br />
Off to the ships, my share of reward for my toil in the
bloodshed!<br />
So now go I to Phthia, for better by much it beseems me<br />
Homeward go with my beaked ships now, and I hold not in

I being outraged, thou mayst gather here plunder and

Ravening king of the folk, for that thou hast thy rule over

Yea, by the sceptre here, and it surely bears branches and

Never again, since first it was lopped from its trunk on the

clipped off<br />
Leaves and the bark; ay, verify now do the sons of Achaia,<br />
Guardian hands of the counsels of Zeus, pronouncing the
judgement,<br />
Hold it aloft; so now unto thee shall the oath have its
portent;<br />
Loud will the cry for Achilles burst from the sons of Achaia<br

MARSHALLING OF THE ACHAIANS</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Like</span> as a terrible
fire feeds fast on a forest enormous,<br />
Up on a mountain height, and the blaze of it radiates round
far,<br />
So on the bright blest arms of the host in their march did the
splendour<br />
Gleam wide round through the circle of air right up to the
sky-vault.<br />
They, now, as when swarm thick in the air multitudinous winged
flocks,<br />
Be it of geese or of cranes or the long-necked troops of the
wild-swans,<br />
Off that Asian mead, by the flow of the waters of
Ka&iuml;stros;<br />
Hither and yon fly they, and rejoicing in pride of their
pinions,<br />
Clamour, shaped to their ranks, and the mead all about them
resoundeth;<br />
So those numerous tribes from their ships and their shelterings
poured forth<br />
On that plain of Scamander, and horrible rumbled beneath them<br
/>
Earth to the quick-paced feet of the men and the tramp of the
horse-hooves.<br />
Stopped they then on the fair-flower&rsquo;d field of Scamander,
their thousands<br />
Many as leaves and the blossoms born of the flowerful season.<br
/>
Even as countless hot-pressed flies in their multitudes
traverse,<br />
<a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>Clouds
of them, under some herdsman&rsquo;s wonning, where then are the
milk-pails<br />
Also, full of their milk, in the bountiful season of
spring-time;<br />
Even so thickly the long-haired sons of Achaia the plain held,<br
/>
Prompt for the dash at the Trojan host, with the passion to crush
them.<br />
Those, likewise, as the goatherds, eyeing their vast flocks of
goats, know<br />
Easily one from the other when all get mixed o&rsquo;er the
pasture,<br />
So did the chieftains rank them here there in their places for
onslaught,<br />
Hard on the push of the fray; and among them King Agamemnon,<br
/>
He, for his eyes and his head, as when Zeus glows glad in his
thunder,<br />
He with the girdle of Ares, he with the breast of Poseidon.</p>

AGAMEMNON IN THE FIGHT</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">These</span>, then, he
left, and away where ranks were now clashing the thickest,<br />
Onward rushed, and with him rushed all of the bright-greaved
Achaians.<br />
Foot then footmen slew, that were flying from direful
compulsion,<br />
Horse at the horsemen (up from off under them mounted the
dust-cloud,<br />
Up off the plain, raised up cloud-thick by the thundering
horse-hooves)<br />
Hewed with the sword&rsquo;s sharp edge; and so meanwhile Lord
Agamemnon<br />
Followed, chasing and slaughtering aye, on-urgeing the
Argives.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, as when fire voracious catches the
unclipp&egrave;d wood-land,<br />
This way bears it and that the great whirl of the wind, and the
scrubwood<br />
Stretches uptorn, flung forward alength by the fire&rsquo;s fury
rageing,<br />
So beneath Atreides Agamemnon heads of the scattered<br />
Trojans fell; and in numbers amany the horses, neck-stiffened,<br
/>
Rattled their vacant cars down the roadway gaps of the
war-field,<br />
Missing the blameless charioteers, but, for these, they were
outstretched<br />
Flat upon earth, far dearer to vultures than to their
home-mates.</p>

Forth of his ambush leapt, and he vaunted him, uttering
thiswise:<br />
&ldquo;Hit thou art! not in vain flew the shaft; how by rights it
had pierced thee<br />
Into the undermost gut, therewith to have rived thee of
life-breath!<br />
Following that had the Trojans plucked a new breath from their

They all frighted of thee, as the goats bleat in flight from a

Then unto him untroubled made answer stout Diomedes:<br />
&ldquo;Bow-puller, jiber, thy bow for thy glorying, spyer at

If that thou dared&rsquo;st face me here out in the open with
weapons,<br />
Nothing then would avail thee thy bow and thy thick shot of
arrows.<br />
Now thou plumest thee vainly because of a graze of my
footsole;<br />
Reck I as were that stroke from a woman or some pettish
infant.<br />
Aye flies blunted the dart of the man that&rsquo;s emasculate,
noughtworth!<br />
Otherwise hits, forth flying from me, and but strikes it the

My keen shaft, and it numbers a man of the dead fallen
straightway.<br />

There hung Hypnos fast, ere the vision of Zeus was observant,<br

Mounted upon a tall pine-tree, tallest of pines that on Ida<br />
Lustily spring off soil for the shoot up aloft into aether.<br />
There did he sit well-cloaked by the wide-branched pine for

Wept, since first they were ware of their charioteer overthrown

Cast down low in the whirl of the dust under man-slaying
Hector.<br />
Sooth, meanwhile, then did Automedon, brave son of Diores,<br />
Oft, on the one hand, urge them with flicks of the swift whip,
and oft, too,<br />
Coax entreatingly, hurriedly; whiles did he angrily threaten.<br

Vainly, for these would not to the ships, to the Hellespont

Backward turn, nor be whipped to the battle among the

<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">rainless</span> darkness
drew o&rsquo;er the lake<br />
As we lay in our boat with oars unshipped.<br />
It seemed neither cloud nor water awake,<br />
And forth of the low black curtain slipped<br />
Thunderless lightning.&nbsp; Scoff no more<br />
At angels imagined in downward flight<br />
For the daughters of earth as fabled of yore:<br />
Here was beauty might well invite<br />
Dark heavens to gleam with the fire of a sun<br />
Resurgent; here the exchanged embrace<br />
Worthy of heaven and earth made one.</p>
<p class="poetry">And witness it, ye of the privileged space,<br

Said the flash; and the mountains, as from an abyss<br />
For quivering seconds leaped up to attest<br />
That given, received, renewed was the kiss;<br />
The lips to lips and the breast to breast;<br />
All in a glory of ecstasy, swift<br />
As an eagle at prey, and pure as the prayer<br />
Of an infant bidden joined hands uplift<br />
To be guarded through darkness by spirits of air,<br />
Ere setting the sails of sleep till day.<br />
Slowly the low cloud swung, and far<br />
It panted along its mirrored way;<br />
Above loose threads one sanctioning star,<br />
The wonder of what had been witnessed, sealed,<br />
And with me still as in crystal glassed<br />
Are the depths alight, the heavens revealed,<br />
Where on to the Alps the muteness passed.</p>

In all that quickens pride, and wise<br />

The tender humour and the fire of sense<br />
In your good eyes; how full of heart for all,<br />

Then see I round you Death his shadows dense<br />
Divide, and at your feet his emblems fall.<br />
For surely are you one with the white host,<br />

Through the great love of Earth they had: lo, these,<br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
